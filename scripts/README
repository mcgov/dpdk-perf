### Notes:

- Copy the contents of this directory to two Standard_E192ids_v6 VMs which share a subnet on their second Azure NIC. Something like `scp -r scripts/ $USER@$IP_ADDRESS:` should work.

- Start the receiver script on one VM

- Start the sender script on the other VM, providing the sender and receiver IPs to testpmd with the -s and -r options. These arguments should be the private IP addresses of the second nic on the VMs (typically named 'eth1').

Note that if you use eth0 as the testpmd NIC, you may lose your SSH connection to the VM.
